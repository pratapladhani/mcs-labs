- ‚úÖ Professional layout with page numbers and headers

**üéØ Local/CI Parity (CRITICAL)**:
- Local PDF generation MUST match GitHub Actions exactly to prevent deployment failures
- **Always test locally before pushing** if you modify lab content, diagrams, or PDF generation
- See [LOCAL_PDF_GENERATION.md](./docs/LOCAL_PDF_GENERATION.md) for complete testing guide

```powershell
# Test PDF generation locally before pushing
.\scripts\Generate-Labs.ps1 -GeneratePDFs

# Quick test for a single lab
.\scripts\Generate-Labs.ps1 -SingleLabPDF "your-lab-name" -GeneratePDFs
```

### üöÄ Quick Start (For Developers)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: After cloning, you must generate content files first:

```powershell
# REQUIRED: Generate Jekyll content from lab sources
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Generate-Labs.ps1 -SkipPDFs

# Then start development server
docker-compose up -d

# Access the site at:
# http://localhost:4000/mcs-labs/
```

**Note**: The `index.md` files are auto-generated and not stored in git. Always run the generation script after cloning!

**Note**: The `/mcs-labs/` path is required for local testing due to Jekyll's baseurl configuration.
