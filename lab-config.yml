# Simplified Lab Configuration - Auto-Discovery Based
# Only contains journey definitions and optional section customizations
# Labs are automatically discovered from folders and README files
#
# IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION NOTES:
# =================================
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: When adding a NEW LAB to the labs/ folder:
# 1. Create the lab folder and README.md in labs/
# 2. Add an entry to lab_metadata section (assign a number and metadata)
# 3. Add an entry to lab_orders section (set the display order)
# 4. Add to lab_journeys section (assign to one or more journeys)
# 5. Add to event-specific lab_orders if needed (bootcamp, workshop, etc.)
# 6. Run Generate-Labs.ps1 to generate the Jekyll files
# 7. Test locally before committing
#
# JOURNEY SYSTEM:
# - The 'journeys' section defines journey cards displayed on the homepage
# - Only journeys listed here will appear as cards on the main page
# - Events (Bootcamp, Workshops) are intentionally EXCLUDED from homepage display
#
# EVENT SYSTEM (Bootcamp & Workshops):
# - Events have dedicated pages with custom numbering and lab sequences
# - Event configuration: event_configs section centralizes titles and metadata
# - Event lab orders: <event_name>_lab_orders defines lab sequence per event
# - Event navigation: Links hardcoded in _layouts/default.html header
# - Event context: All events use unified ?event=<event-name> parameter
#
# LAB ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM:
# - lab_journeys section assigns individual labs to their respective journeys
# - Labs can be assigned to multiple journeys for cross-journey visibility
# - Event labs are NOT assigned here to prevent homepage appearance
#
# NAVIGATION ARCHITECTURE:
# - Homepage: Shows journey cards (excludes events)
# - Top Navigation: Home | All Labs | Bootcamp | Azure AI Workshop | MCS in a Day
# - Event Pages: Use <event_name>_lab_orders for custom sequencing
# - All Labs Page: Shows all labs regardless of journey/event assignment

# =====================================================
# EVENT CONFIGURATIONS - Centralized event metadata
# =====================================================
# This section provides metadata for all events (Bootcamp, Workshops, etc.)
# Used by JavaScript in _layouts/lab.html for dynamic navigation and filtering
#
# Event URL Pattern: /labs/<lab-id>/?event=<event-name>
# JavaScript Detection: Reads ?event= parameter and looks up config_key
# Lab Ordering: Each event has corresponding <config_key> section below
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS:
# - Single source of truth for event titles and icons
# - Enables JavaScript to map ?event=bootcamp → bootcamp_lab_orders
# - Simplifies adding new events (add entry here + create lab_orders section)
# - Maintains consistency across event pages and navigation

# LAB JOURNEY ASSIGNMENTS - Explicit journey mapping
# =====================================================
# This section provides explicit control over which journeys each lab belongs to.
# If a lab is listed here, it will use these exact journey assignments.
# If a lab is NOT listed here, the script will auto-assign journeys based on
# difficulty levels and content analysis (fallback behavior).
#
# Format: lab-folder-name: ["journey1", "journey2", ...]
# Available journeys: quick-start, business-user, developer, autonomous-ai

# =====================================================
# AUTO-DISCOVERY RULES (Optional - for documentation)
# =====================================================
# The system automatically:
# 1. Scans labs/ folders for README.md files
# 2. Extracts metadata from lab details tables
# 3. Auto-assigns sections based on:
#    - Difficulty levels (100=core, 200=intermediate, 300+=advanced)
#    - Folder name patterns (autonomous=advanced, 30-mins=optional, etc.)
# 4. Auto-assigns journeys based on:
#    - Difficulty and content analysis
#    - Keywords in titles and descriptions
# 5. Uses intelligent defaults for missing metadata

# To override auto-assignment, add YAML front matter to lab README files:
# ---
# journeys: ["custom-journey"]
# section: "custom_section"
# difficulty: 150
# duration: 45
# ---# Force trigger
