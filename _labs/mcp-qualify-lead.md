## 🤔 Why This Matters

**For sales leaders and CRM admins** - Lead overload is a common problem.

Think of a sales team like a firefighter squad:

- **Without AI prioritization**: They’re chasing every alarm, wasting time and missing real fires.
- **With AI prioritization**: They focus on the biggest, hottest leads – fast and smart.

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**

- "We’re missing hot leads because we can’t triage fast enough."
- "Our sellers are overwhelmed with too many low-priority leads."
- "We need a smarter way to focus our sales efforts."

**In just 15 minutes, you’ll learn how to use AI to help your sales team work smarter—not harder.**

## 🌐 Introduction

In today’s competitive sales environment, identifying and acting on the right leads at the right time is critical. Sellers are often overwhelmed by the volume of leads and lack the tools to quickly determine which ones are worth pursuing.

**Real-world example:** A sales team receives hundreds of leads per week. Without automation, they spend hours reviewing CRM data. As a result, some of the best opportunities are missed or delayed.

With D365 Sales Model Context Protocol and AI: AI analyzes lead data, engagement history, and contextual signals to surface the most promising leads. Sellers get a prioritized list—no guesswork, no delay.
