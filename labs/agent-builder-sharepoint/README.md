## 📁 Use Case #1: Access SharePoint documents

Prepare the SharePoint documents that will serve as knowledge sources for your Sales Admin Assistant.

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Navigate to SharePoint

    - Open the **Sales** folder 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The URL of the SharePoint site is available in **Lab Resources** (specific per training).

2. Locate the following sample files:
   - **Sales Excel file**: A spreadsheet containing sales data with columns for dates, product lines, revenue, and quarters
   - **Sales policy document**: A Word document containing sales policies, procedures, and guidelines

3. Open the **Excel file** and note the data structure:
   - Ensure it contains sales data across multiple quarters/years
   - Verify product line categorization

4. Open the **Word policy document** and review:
   - Sales procedures and guidelines
   - Policy information that might inform sales decisions
   - Any specific requirements or compliance information

## 🤖 Use Case #2: Create your Sales Admin Assistant agent

Build a specialized agent with SharePoint integration and advanced AI capabilities.

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Create the agent

1. Navigate to [Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?auth=2&home=1) and go to the **Chat** tab.

2. On the side pane, expand **Agents** and select **Create agent**.

3. When prompted to **describe the agent**, use this specific prompt:

```
You are a Sales Admin Assistant. Your job is to help sales managers track revenue and identify trends across product lines. You understand product hierarchies, time periods (e.g. quarters, fiscal years), and sales metrics. Users can ask questions like 'Graph the sales for the last 2 years with a breakdown per product line and quarter'. You always respond in a friendly and professional tone, aiming to be helpful and insightful.
```

4. **Confirm** the suggested agent name when prompted.

#### Configure knowledge sources

5. Now head over to the **Configure** tab
   - Under **Knowledge**, navigate to **Files**
   - Add each of the 2 files you had opened in the previous use case.

## 🧪 Use Case #3: Test advanced AI capabilities

Validate your agent's ability to work with SharePoint data and advanced AI features.

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Test policy knowledge

1. Select **Go to agent** to start testing.

2. First, test the agent's **knowledge** of your sales policy:

```
What are the key guidelines in our sales policy regarding customer discounts?
```

3. Verify the agent references your SharePoint policy document and provides accurate information.

#### Test code interpreter with data analysis

4. **Start a new chat** and test the **code interpreter** capability with a data analysis request:

```
Analyze sales data for the last 2 years with a breakdown per product line and quarter. Use data from Sales.xlsx.
```

5. When offered to get a visual chart of this breakdown, **confirm**.

6. **Observe** how the agent:
   - Accesses your Excel data from SharePoint
   - Uses code interpreter to process the data
   - Generates dynamic charts and visualizations
   - Provides insights based on the analysis

#### Test image generation

6. **Start a new chat** and test the **image generation** capability with a relevantrequest:

```
Create a badge for the first place of our sales context for 2026
```
