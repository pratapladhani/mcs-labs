## 🤔 Why This Matters

**Makers and Developers** - Stop struggling with disconnected data systems and manual query writing that limits your AI agents' potential.

Think of multi-agent communication like having a team of specialized experts:

- **Without connected agents**: Each system works in isolation, requiring manual data extraction and integration, leading to slower insights and limited capabilities
- **With connected agents**: Your Copilot Studio agent can seamlessly delegate data queries to specialized Fabric agents, providing instant, accurate analytics without manual intervention

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**

- "My Copilot can't access our Fabric data models directly"
- "We need complex SQL knowledge to query our semantic models"
- "Our agents can't collaborate to answer multi-faceted business questions"
- "Setting up data connections for each agent is time-consuming and error-prone"

**In just 20 minutes, you'll transform isolated systems into a collaborative AI ecosystem that amplifies your organization's data intelligence capabilities.**

#### Testing Initial Functionality

1. Navigate to the **Test** pane and try these baseline queries:

    ```
    What is our total revenue?
    Show me the top 5 products by sales
    How many customers do we have?
    ```

2. Verify that the agent returns data-backed responses, by drilling down in the response you should be able to see the DAX used.

#### Optimizing with Meta-Prompts

1. In the **Setup** section, locate the **Agent instructions** field. (Alternatively, you can also locate the **Agent instructions** in the navigation bar on the top.)

2. Generate agent-level instructions using this meta-prompt in the **test pane** (on the right where it says **Test the agent's responses**):

    ```
    Meta-Prompt: Generate Agent-Level Instructions:
    Analyze your available data sources and create agent-level instructions for yourself (max 15000 chars).

    Objective: {AGENT_OBJECTIVE}
    Users: {USER_PERSONA}

    Examine your data sources: list all sources, types, and primary use. Analyze domain, time coverage, and main themes.

    Generate instructions with:
    ## Objective
    ## Data Sources (list with priority)
    ## Key Terminology (infer from columns/measures)
    ## Response Guidelines
    Style: {RESPONSE_STYLE}
    ## Handling Common Topics (3-5 based on available data)

    Custom terms: {CUSTOM_TERMINOLOGY}
    ```

   When using this meta-prompt, replace the variables manually in the prompt as per the values below **OR** paste these in the Test:

   - `{AGENT_OBJECTIVE}`: "E-commerce analytics agent for business intelligence"
   - `{USER_PERSONA}`: "Business analysts and sales teams"
   - `{RESPONSE_STYLE}`: "Clear summaries with data citations and trend analysis"
   - `{CUSTOM_TERMINOLOGY}`: Leave empty or add your domain-specific terms

3. Copy the generated response, review and adjust as needed, then paste it into the **Agent Instructions** field.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Always review generated instructions for accuracy and completeness. The meta-prompt provides a strong foundation but may need minor adjustments for your specific use case.

#### Optional meta prompt if your model is not a semantic model and has multiple tables, generate data source instructions using

    ```
    Meta-Prompt: Generate Data Source Instructions
    Analyze data source {DATA_SOURCE_NAME} and create instructions (max 15000 chars).

    Examine: tables, columns, measures, relationships, hierarchies, date ranges, fact vs dimension tables, grain, data quality.

    Infer business context, KPIs, common filters.

    Generate:
    ## General Knowledge (domain, coverage, refresh)
    ## Table Descriptions (name, purpose, key columns, grain)
    ## Measures Catalog (name, calculation, usage)
    ## Relationships
    ## When Asked About [Topic] (tables, measures, filters, logic per topic)
    ## Query Best Practices (time filtering, joins, performance)

    Terms: {CUSTOM_TERMINOLOGY}
    ```

   Replace `{DATA_SOURCE_NAME}` with "e-commerce-order-dataset"

4. Test the enhanced agent with more complex queries:

    ```
    What's the average order value by customer segment?
    Which payment methods are most popular for high-value orders?
    Show me monthly revenue trends with year-over-year comparison
    ```

#### Publishing the Agent

1. Generate the agent description using this meta-prompt inside the test pane of your Fabric Agent

    ```
    Meta-Prompt: Generate Agent Description
    Create a 1-2 sentence description of yourself as a Fabric Data Agent (max 200 chars).

    Analyze your data sources and describe: what data domain you cover and what questions you answer.

    Example: "Fabric Data Agent for retail sales. Answers questions about revenue, products, customers, and trends."

    Output plain text only.
    ```

2. Click **Publish** and paste the generated description in the purpose and capabilities field.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
