## ü§î Why This Matters

**Makers and Business Users** - Many professionals face challenges integrating data sources, automating workflows, and ensuring that business applications are both flexible and secure.

Think of your current sales workflow:
- **Without Copilot Agent**: Sales reps have to log into multiple applications to access or update account and contact data, navigating complex menus and switching between Teams and Dataverse, which slows down workflows
- **With Copilot Agent**: Sales reps read, create, and update Dataverse records directly from Teams using natural language, without leaving their main workspace

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**
- "I need to switch between too many applications to get my work done"
- "Accessing and updating customer data takes too long and interrupts my flow"
- "I want to use natural language to interact with business data"
- "My team needs a unified workspace that connects to our enterprise data"

**By completing this 30-minute lab, you'll gain practical skills that translate directly to real-world scenarios and address complexity, time investment, and technical barriers.**

In this section, you'll learn how to create custom prompts that structure agent responses to show specific Dataverse fields and provide consistent output formats.

**Scenario:** Different users might get varying levels of detail when querying account information. By creating structured prompts, you ensure all users receive consistent, relevant account details that support their business decisions.

### Step-by-step instructions

15. If you tried some different testing in the Copilot, you may have noticed you will get different attributes for accounts and contacts. If you want a more structured response, you can create a prompt in the Tools. In the **Tools** tab, click **+ Add a tool** then **+ New tool**.

    ![Add new tool for prompt](images/step13-add-new-tool.png)

16. Select **Prompt**.

    ![Select Prompt](images/step14-select-prompt.png)

17. Rename the prompt at the top to `Show Account Details`. Then in the instructions type: `Find account which contains` and then click **+ Add content** to pass in the name of the account we are searching for. Select **Text** for the Input and call it `Account Name`. Click **close**.

    ![Rename prompt](images/step15-rename-prompt.png)

18. We can now grab specific fields from Dataverse to show to our end users in the chat. Click back in the instructions and type `and find relevant details like:` click **+ Add content**. This time we will select **Dataverse** and some of the fields in the Account table which we feel our end users would like to see about the account.

19. Let's select the following by clicking on the dropdown: **Account Name**, **Account Number**, **Address 1**, **Annual Revenue**, **Email** and **Main Phone**. Click **Add** and then **Save**.
