## 🤔 Why This Matters

**IT Support Teams and Makers** - Tired of manually responding to repetitive support emails and constantly checking ticket statuses?

Think of a traditional help desk:
- **Without autonomous agents**: Support staff manually reads every email, searches knowledge bases, checks ticket systems, and crafts individual responses - consuming hours of valuable time
- **With autonomous agents**: AI automatically processes incoming emails, searches your knowledge base, retrieves ticket information, and sends comprehensive responses in seconds

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**
- "Our support team spends too much time on routine email inquiries"
- "Users have to wait hours for simple password reset instructions"
- "We can't scale our support to handle increasing ticket volumes"
- "Checking ticket statuses across systems is time-consuming and error-prone"

**In just 20 minutes, you'll transform how your organization handles support requests, freeing your team to focus on complex issues that truly need human expertise.**

## 🌐 Introduction

Customer support automation has become essential for organizations looking to scale their operations while maintaining high service quality. Manual email responses and ticket lookups create bottlenecks that frustrate both support staff and end users.

**Real-world example:** A mid-sized company receives 200+ support emails daily asking about password resets, ticket statuses, and common troubleshooting steps. Without automation, their 3-person support team spends 60% of their time on these routine inquiries, leaving complex issues unaddressed and creating long response times.

After implementing autonomous agents, the same company now handles 80% of routine inquiries automatically, with instant responses that include personalized ticket updates and relevant knowledge base articles. The support team can focus on strategic initiatives and complex problem-solving, while user satisfaction increases due to immediate, accurate responses.

#### Testing Your Complete Agent

31. **Send** a test email to your ficitious user email by using the **Send Support Email** form. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To access this form, use the provided values in the **Lab Resources** (specific per training).
>
> The email should contain something like this:
>   ```
>   Hi!
>   
>   I hope you're doing well!
>   
>   I had a couple of questions - what are the steps again to reset your Now Support user password?
>   Also, was wondering if you had an update on my cases INC0000059 and INC0000055
>   
>   Much appreciated.
>   Thanks!
>   ```

32. Make sure you **receive** the email in your **inbox**, in [outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com/mail/)

> [!TIP]
> You don't need to repeat the original trigger event to make more tests. In the **Test** pane, you can select `...`, choose **Test trigger** and then select the desired trigger and from there, decide to execute a past trigger again.
> 
> ![alt text](images/test-trigger.png)

33. Check the execution of your  autonomus agent by going to the **Activity** tab. Select the **Refresh** icon until you see the execution.

34. Check the emails in your **Sent** folder in Outlook to see the actual reply the user autonomously sent.

> [!TIP]
> - Agents can be both conversational and autonomous. Meaning that they can be triggered by an email (such as an email received) or by an end-user simply using a chat or voice interface. 
> - If the agent is purely autonomous, you can safely **delete** the default custom topics that are useless to it:
>   - Goodbye
>   - Greeting
>   - Start Over
>   - Thank you
> - You can also **disable** the system topics that it won't need:
>   - Conversation start
>   - Conversational boosting
>   - End of conversation
>   - Escalate
>   - Fallback
>   - Multiple topics matched
