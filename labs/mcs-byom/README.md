## ü§î Why This Matters

Using different AI models in Copilot Studio allows agents to leverage each model's strengths; such as reasoning, creativity, or precision for specific tasks. This ensures higher accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability across diverse use cases.

Azure AI Foundry brings the latest frontier models into your Copilot Studio prompts. You can access a diverse portfolio of AI models, including cutting-edge open-source solutions, industry-specific models, and task-based AI capabilities.

This lab demonstrates how Copilot Studio provides flexibility to integrate models from Azure AI Foundry into your Copilot Studio agents using the Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) capability---enabling specialized AI functionality tailored to your business needs and real-world automation scenarios.

**Think of your current contract management workflow:**

- **Without intelligent agents**, sales operations teams must manually identify contract risks---a slow, repetitive, and error-prone process that reduces efficiency and increases the chance of oversight.

- **With intelligent agents**, you can automatically apply your company's specific rules and regulations to identify and categorize contract risks. For example, when a user asks the agent about potential risks, it considers all relevant factors and internal guidelines to deliver a more accurate and consistent risk assessment.

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**

- **Inconsistent Risk Assessment:** The agent ensures all contracts are evaluated using standardized rules and criteria, reducing human bias and variability.
- **Time-Consuming Manual Review:** It automates the risk identification process, significantly speeding up contract analysis and freeing teams for higher-value tasks.

**By bringing your own model from Azure AI Foundry, makers learn to:**

- Use a diverse portfolio of AI models, including cutting-edge open-source solutions, industry-specific models, and task-based AI capabilities.
- Apply an industry-specific model to a specific task within your agent.

## üåê Introduction

As organizations increasingly embrace AI agents, the demand for domain-specific agents is growing rapidly. For example, in sales operations, teams often need to manually identify contract risks---a slow, repetitive, and error-prone process. This manual approach not only reduces efficiency but also increases the likelihood of oversight and compliance issues.

As AI agents mature, there's a clear shift toward leveraging domain-specific models tailored for specialized tasks. For instance, models trained for risk identification can be integrated into sales operations to automatically detect potential contract risks, enabling faster, more accurate, and consistent decision-making.

This lab focuses on using industry-specific and task-based AI models for specific agent scenarios through the Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) capability.

## üéì Core Concepts Overview

| Concept                              | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adding Tools and Configuration**   | In Copilot Studio, **Tools** are pre-built or custom components that let your agent perform actions, fetch data, or integrate with other systems. They act like skills or plugins, giving your agent specific powers beyond simple conversation.                                                                             |
| **Using Prompts as Tool**            | In Copilot Studio, **Prompts** are instructions or templates that guide the Large Language Model (LLM), such as GPT, and small language models on how to think, respond, or generate content. They work like a smart script for your AI, helping it reason, retrieve information, and produce useful, context-aware answers. |
| **Create Reusable Prompt Templates** | In Copilot Studio, you can create reusable natural language instructions that harness both large and small language models to perform tasks such as summarization, reasoning, or data extraction.                                                                                                                            |

| Intelligent Assessments | Enable intelligent assessments based on predefined criteria | 30 minutes       |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll learn how to use **Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)** in Prompts for a specific task. In this lab, you'll create a custom Prompt that automatically retrieves results from a knowledge source --- in this case, an **Azure AI Search Index** --- and allows you to execute a custom prompt to gather additional insights and perform entity extraction, reasoning based on business requirements.

Using this approach, you can create custom prompts tailored to specific scenarios. The **Azure AI Foundry** service offers a wide range of generative AI models, and depending on your business needs, latency, and other factors, you can bring those models into Copilot Studio through custom prompts instead of relying on the default models. Additionally, this approach allows you to use simpler, more focused instructions for your agents while handling domain-specific tasks or assessments through prompts. This makes managing instructions and prompts more flexible and efficient.

**Scenario:** The user needs to run some predefined assessments --- for example, a **risk assessment** on contracts which are stored in the knowledge source--- and generate an instant report.

### Objective

Create a reusable prompt template that leverages Azure AI Foundry models to perform intelligent contract risk assessment based on predefined criteria.

3. Select **Prompt**.

4. Provide a unique name, for example: `RiskAssessment-YourName`

5. Click on **+ Add Content** and select input as **text** and give it a name: `Contract`.

6. Add the following prompt with input of type text called `contract`:

    ```
    You are tasked with reviewing **contract** details to identify and flag any potential risks. Your goal is to analyze the provided contract thoroughly and extract risk items based solely on the information contained within it.
    
    ### Instructions:
    
    1. Carefully read and understand the contract details.
    
    2. Identify all potential risks present in the contract.
    
    3. Categorize each risk by its severity level: High, Medium, or Low.
    
    4. List the risks ordered by severity:
    - Highest risks first
    - Followed by medium risks
    - Then low risks
    
    5. For each risk, provide a clear and concise reasoning explaining why it is considered a risk.
    
    6. Ensure all information and risk assessments are factually accurate and strictly derived from the provided contract details.
    
    These are the **Contract Risk Assessment Questionnaire that will help you in the assessment**:

    Does the agreement adequately protect sensitive data and comply with applicable privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?
    
    **Intellectual Property Rights:**
    Are ownership and usage rights for intellectual property clearly defined---especially for deliverables, software, or creative outputs?
    
    **Compliance and Legal Obligations:**
    Does the contract ensure adherence to all relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, including export controls or anti-bribery clauses?
    
    **Dispute Resolution:**
    Are the mechanisms for dispute resolution (e.g., arbitration, jurisdiction, governing law) clearly established and practical?
    
    **Force Majeure and Unforeseen Events:**
    Does the contract include a comprehensive force majeure clause that adequately addresses risks such as natural disasters, pandemics, or supply disruptions?
    
    **Performance and Penalty Clauses:**
    Are there clear performance metrics, service-level agreements (SLAs), and penalties for non-performance or delays?
    ```

7. Click on the **Models** tab and select **Azure AI Foundry Models**.
