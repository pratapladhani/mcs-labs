## 🤔 Why Master ALM Deployment?

**Ready to move beyond development?** You've built amazing agents in your dev environment, but now you need to deploy them safely and consistently to test and production environments.

Think of deployment pipelines as your quality assurance assembly line:
- **Without pipelines**: Manual exports, forgotten configurations, "it worked in dev" syndrome
- **With pipelines**: Automated, consistent, auditable deployments with proper validation

**Common deployment challenges solved by proper ALM:**
- "My agent works perfectly in dev but breaks in production"
- "I forgot to configure the authentication settings after deployment"
- "Someone deployed directly to production and bypassed testing"
- "I can't track what changed between versions"

**This lab transforms deployment from a risky manual process into a confident, repeatable workflow!**

## 🌐 Introduction

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) deployment ensures your solutions move safely and consistently from development through testing to production. This lab builds on ALM foundations to implement automated deployment pipelines and understand the complete deployment lifecycle.

**Real-world example:** Your customer service agent is ready for production, but deployment involves:
1. Exporting the solution as managed
2. Importing to test environment for validation
3. Configuring environment-specific settings
4. Testing functionality end-to-end
5. Promoting to production with proper approvals
6. Configuring production-specific security and channels

With Power Platform pipelines, this becomes an automated, governed process with built-in approvals and validation!

## 🎓 Core Concepts Overview

| Concept | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Power Platform pipelines** | Democratized ALM automation that brings CI/CD capabilities into the service in a manner that's approachable for all makers, admins, and developers. Significantly reduces effort and domain knowledge previously required for healthy ALM processes. |
| **Pipeline stages** | Sequential deployment environments (Development → Test → Production) that solutions must pass through in order, preventing bypass of QA processes and ensuring proper validation at each stage. |
| **Service principal deployments** | Option to deploy using service principal identity instead of the user maker's identity for consistent ownership and automation scenarios. |
| **Solution artifacts** | Exported solutions that remain unchanged throughout the pipeline, ensuring the same tested artifact moves through all stages without tampering or modification. |
| **Managed vs Unmanaged Solutions** | Managed solutions are read-only deployments for downstream environments (test/prod). Unmanaged solutions should be used only in development. |
| **Solution-aware vs Non-solution-aware** | Some Copilot Studio settings travel with solutions, others require manual post-deployment configuration. Understanding this distinction is critical for successful deployments. |
| **Managed Environments** | Governance feature that enforces managed solution deployments and prevents unauthorized customizations in target environments. |

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Create Power Platform pipelines for deployment | Automate with confidence – Set up governed, repeatable deployment workflows that democratize ALM for all makers while maintaining security and control. | 10 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll learn how to create Power Platform pipelines, configure deployment stages, and set up automated deployments for controlled releases.

**Scenario:** You have a solution ready in DEV and need to establish an automated process to deploy it to a PROD environment with minimal effort and maximum consistency.

### Objective

Create a deployment pipeline that automates solution deployment across environments with proper validation and governance controls.

---

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Get a PROD environment

> [!TIP]
> If you haven't done so already, you need to request a PROD environment to be created for your user. This is a one-time setup step that will allow you to create pipelines for deployment.

1. **Start** by requesting a PROD envrionment to be created for your user. Use the **Workshop Agent** to request this environment, which will be automatically created for you. This will then take a couple of minutes to provision and to show up.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Access the workshop agent in the same location as when you created your training user account.  You will need the workshop code and your training user's email address if you previously closed 
the agent. Tell the agent to "Provision a PROD environment".  You are limited to a single PROD environment for the duration workshop.

#### Access Power Platform pipelines

1. Navigate to the Copilot Studio home page at https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/

2. Go to the **Solutions** menu (located in the left-hand menu under the ellipsis `...`) of your DEV environment

3. Select the solution you had created previously for your labs

4. In the left navigation, select **Pipelines**.

5. Select **+ Create new pipeline**.

#### Configure pipeline basics

6. Enter a **Name** for your pipeline, e.g., `<your user name> Pipeline`.

7. Set a **Description** to explain the pipeline's purpose (e.g., `Automated deployment of agents from DEV to PROD`).

#### Set up deployment stage

8. **Select** the **PROD** environment as the **Target environment**. 

9. **Save** the pipeline configuration.

![alt text](images/pipeline.png)

#### Test your pipeline

13. In the PROD card, select **Deploy here**.

> [!TIP]
> - The wizard then makes sure that each environment variable has a value set in the target environment, and that all connection references are valid. If any of these checks fail, you will be prompted to fix them before proceeding. 
> - If the deployment fails because of missing dependencies make sure to go back to your solution explorer, click on the 3-dots next to each agents > Advanced > Add required objects and try re-deploying the solution.

14. In Copilot Studio, **switch** to the PROD environment.

15. **See** what the agents look like in the PROD environment. When entering a topic, see how customizations are locked because the solution is managed.

---

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Access source control in Copilot Studio

1. Return to your DEV environment in [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/).

2. Open your solution and navigate to **Source control**.

3. Review any uncommitted changes from pipeline configuration or deployment preparation.

#### Commit pipeline deployment changes

4. Select any modified components that should be committed.

5. Add a meaningful commit message: "Pipeline deployment: Production-ready configuration with automated ALM"

6. Select **Commit** to save changes to your branch.

#### Explore solution structure in Azure DevOps

7. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project and browse to **Repos**.

8. Explore the **Solutions** folder structure:
   ```
   Solutions/
   ├── [SolutionName]/
   │   ├── botcomponents/
   │   ├── bots/
   │   ├── connectionreferences/
   │   ├── environmentvariabledefinitions/
   │   ├── publishers/
   │   └── solutions/
   ```

#### Understand component organization

9. Examine key folders:
   - **ConnectionReferences/**: Contains connection reference definitions used by connectors, flows, and tools.
   - **EnvironmentVariables/**: Contains environment variable definitions and values
   - **Workflows/**: Contains Power Automate flows (if any)
   - **Other/Copilot/**: Contains Copilot Studio agents and components
   - **SolutionPackage/**: Contains the overall solution metadata

10. Open a component file to see the XML, YAML, or JSON structure that defines these components.

11. Notice how this structure enables:
    - Granular tracking of changes to individual components
    - Easy integration with other CI/CD tools and processes
    - Professional development workflows for larger teams

#### Review deployment history

12. Go to **Repos** > **Commits** to see your deployment history.

13. Compare commits to understand what changes between deployments.

14. Use the diff view to see exactly what components were modified.

## 🏆 Summary of learnings

**ALM golden rules reinforced:**

✅ **Work in the context of solutions** – Pipelines require properly structured solutions for deployment automation.

✅ **Create separate solutions only if you need to deploy components independently** – Pipelines work best with cohesive solution packaging.

✅ **Use a custom publisher and prefix** – Maintains clear ownership in automated deployment scenarios.

✅ **Use environment variables for settings and secrets that change across environments** – Pipelines validate and update these automatically during deployment.

✅ **Export and deploy solutions as managed, unless setting up a dev environment** – Pipelines automatically handle this, ensuring governance and preventing unauthorized changes.

✅ **Don't do customizations outside of dev** – Managed Environments enforce this rule, blocking unmanaged customizations in target environments.

✅ **Consider automating ALM for source control and automated deployments** – Pipelines provide this automation while remaining extensible for advanced scenarios.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Critical reminder about non-solution-aware settings:**
> 
> These Copilot Studio settings require manual post-deployment configuration:
> * **Azure Application Insights settings**
> * **Manual authentication settings**
> * **Direct Line / Web channel security settings** 
> * **Deployed channels**
> * **Sharing (with other makers, or with end-users)**
> 
> Always include these in your post-deployment checklist!

> [!NOTE]
> **Managed Environment governance in your lab:**
> Your PROD environment uses Managed Environment governance to enforce that solutions are managed and unmanaged customizations are blocked. This ensures deployment integrity and prevents unauthorized changes outside of the pipeline process.

### Conclusions and recommendations

**Pipeline deployment excellence principles:**

* **Democratize with governance** – Use pipelines to make ALM accessible to all makers while maintaining enterprise-grade security and control.
* **Validate early and often** – Leverage pipeline pre-deployment validation to catch issues before they impact target environments.
* **Automate the repeatable, manage the exceptions** – Let pipelines handle standard deployment tasks while maintaining checklists for non-solution-aware settings.
* **Extend when needed** – Start with pipelines for core deployment, then extend with CLI and CI/CD tools for advanced scenarios.
* **Trust but verify** – Use Managed Environments to enforce governance while providing makers the flexibility to deploy through approved channels.

By mastering Power Platform pipelines, you've established a deployment process that combines the accessibility makers need with the governance and automation enterprises require. Your deployments are now predictable, auditable, and scalable—setting the foundation for confident production releases at any scale.
