## 🤔 Why This Matters

**Makers and IT professionals** - Tired of employees constantly asking the same questions about policies, benefits, or system status? Frustrated by scattered knowledge across multiple systems?

Think of your organization's knowledge like a library:
- **Without an intelligent agent**: Employees waste hours searching through SharePoint folders, submitting IT tickets for simple questions, and interrupting colleagues for information that should be readily available
- **With an intelligent agent**: Employees get instant, accurate answers from a single conversational interface that automatically searches across all your knowledge sources with proper citations

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**
- "I can't find the leave policy for my country in our SharePoint site"
- "What's the status of my ServiceNow incident?"
- "Can someone help me structure these meeting notes properly?"
- "I need information from multiple systems but don't know where to look"

**This 40-minute investment will save your organization countless hours and improve employee satisfaction by providing instant access to knowledge.**

## 🌐 Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, employees need quick access to accurate information from multiple sources. Whether it's HR policies, IT incident status, or custom knowledge bases, information is often scattered across different systems, making it difficult for employees to find what they need efficiently.

**Real-world example:** Imagine Sarah, a new employee in Germany, needs to understand her leave entitlements. Currently, she might spend 30 minutes navigating through SharePoint folders, trying different search terms, or even asking HR colleagues. With an intelligent "Ask me anything" agent, Sarah simply types "What's the leave policy for Germany?" and instantly receives the accurate policy document with proper citations, saving time and reducing frustration.

This lab teaches you to build a comprehensive solution that transforms how employees interact with organizational knowledge, creating a single conversational interface that intelligently routes questions to the right knowledge sources and provides contextual, accurate responses.

## 🔄 Use Case #4: Knowledge Prioritization Techniques

Implement context-aware knowledge routing for personalized and relevant responses.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Knowledge Prioritization Techniques | Implements context-aware knowledge routing for personalized and relevant responses | 8 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll learn different techniques to help prioritize the right knowledge sources based on context.

**Scenario:** The SharePoint site has different folders for different country leave policies. Asking "What's the leave policy?" doesn't return relevant results and seems to randomly pick a leave policy for a country. You need to implement context-aware routing.

### Step-by-step instructions

Let's start by asking for the user country at the beginning of the conversation. In many situations, this can be obtained from context, either passed from a web page to the agent, or by making an initial call (for example to the Entra ID connector) to get more information about the logged-in user and their location.

#### Setting an office location in Entra ID

1. Start by assigning an office location to your user. Use the **Employee Office Location Request Form** to select a **country** in the list. This will update your user's Office location property in Entra ID.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To access this form, use the provided values in the **Lab Resources** (specific per training).

#### Getting the office location of the logged-in user at the start of the conversation

2. Now, in your 'Ask Me Anything' agent, go to the **Topics** tab, and then to the **System topics** tab.

3. Open the **Conversation Start** topic

4. At the beginning of the topic, right after the **Trigger**, add a new node **(+)** and choose **Add a tool**.

5. Go the **Connector** tab, and search for `Microsoft Entra ID Get user`

6. Select the **Get user** connector action and **Submit**.

  ![alt text](images/add-tool-connector.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If you don't see the **Get user** action, select another of the Microsoft Entra ID actions, such as **Create user**  and **Submit**.
> - Then in the topic command bar, select `...` and **Open code editor**.
> - Update `CreateUser` to `GetUser` in both **operationId** and **variable**.
> - Select **Close code editor**.
> - In the **Get user** node, select `...` and **Refresh** 

7. In the **Get user** node, select `...` and **Properties** 

8. Toggle the **End user authentication** to **Agent author authentication**.

9. In the **Inputs** tab, for **User Id or Principal Name**, select `...`, go the the **System** tab, and select **User.Id**.

![alt text](images/select-user-id.png)

10. **Save**

11. Test if everything is working as expected by **refreshing** the conversation test pane. Because the Conversation Start topic automatically start at the beginning of every conversation, the **Get user** action of the **Microsoft Entra ID** connector gets triggered.

12. To see what values are returned from the connector, enter the **Variables** pane in the topic command bar. Go the **Test** to see the variable values at runtime (i.e., as you are testing in the conversation test pane).
  
  ![alt text](images/variables-pane.png)

13. Select **Value** under the **GetUser** record, and **expand** it to see if the expected value was returned.

![alt text](images/user-record-entra-id.png)

14. Because we will need to use that variable value in other parts and topics of the agent, select the **GetUser** variable and make it **Global**.

![alt text](images/set-global-variable.png)

15. **Save**

#### Dynamically filtering the searched SharePoint site with the office location

16. Go to the **Topics** tab, select **+ Add a topic** and choose **From blank**

17. Update the topic name from **Untitled** to `Leave policy`

18. Under **Describe what this topic does** paste: 

```
Use this tool for questions about leave policy, time off, etc.
```

19. Add a new node: **Advanced > Generative answers**

20. For input,  select `...`, go to the **System** tab and choose the **Activity.Text** variable.

> [!TIP]
> The **Activity.Text** variable is super useful because it captures the last message/text the user has typed in or selected when interacting with the agent.

![alt text](images/activity-text.png)

21. Go to the **properties** of the **Create generative answers** node

22. Select **Search only selected sources** and **don't select anything**

> [!TIP]
> This means that none of the knowledge sources that are configured at the top level of your agent will be used.

23. Expand **Classic data**, for **SharePoint** (not Public websites!), toggle **Manual input** to **Formula**

24. Select the `...` and go to the **formula** tab

25. Paste the **SharePoint classic data formula**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Use the formula provided in the **Lab Resources** (specific per training).
> - Notice how the formula concatenates the SharePoint URL with the office location, effectively using context to target the correct source and location for the content.

  ![alt text](images/sharepoint-formulas.png)

26. Select **Insert** once done, then **Save** your topic

27. **Refresh** the test pane and ask:

```
What's the leave policy?
```

28. **Verify** that the leave policy used to generate this answer is the one matching the country you selected.

> [!TIP]
> If formulas are too much code, you could also use condition nodes and configure different branches based on the selected country.

#### Influence knowledge searches with instructions 

29. You can also influence how knowledge searches are performed by updating your agent instructions. Go to the **Overview** tab and go to **Instructions**

30. **Paste** the below line

```
Include the user country () in knowledge search queries (e.g., "<question> in <country>?") that are HR related.
```

31. We need to set the variable value in-between the parenthesis. **Type** `/` and select **Power Fx**.

> [!TIP]
> Note: the UX may differ. In that case, use the **{x}** dropdown to select **Global.GetUser.officeLocation**, and **Save** your instructions.

  ![alt text](images/instructions-formula.png)

31. **Type** `Global.GetUser.officeLocation` and select **Insert**

32. **Test**

```
What benefits do employees get?
```

33. Notice how the query is **rewritten** to take into account the **variables** you provided, like country, **augmenting the chances** of returning the correct results for summarization.

![alt text](images/rewritten-search-query.png)

- **Unified Experience**: Users get comprehensive support from a single agent interface

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Create a child agent

1. Go to your Ask Me Anything agent

2. Go to the **Agents** tab, and **+ Add an agent**

    ![alt text](images/add-agent.png)

3. Update 
    - Its **Name** to: `IT Support Agent`
    - Its **Description** to:
      ```
      Use this agent for queries related to IT (e.g., knowledge base frequently asked questions, incident updates, etc.) 
      The agent can multiple multiple questions and queries at once.
      ```
    - Its **Instructions** to:
      ```
      Use knowledge for problem/how-to/questions.
      Use the Get ServiceNow ticket details tool to get the status of incidents.
      ```

#### Add knowledge to the child agent

4. Select **+ Add** in the **Knowledge** section of the child agent

5. Select **ServiceNow**

3. Search for  `ServiceNow List records`

4. Select **Add to Agent**, then **Save** your child agent, and scroll down to the **Tools** section and select the **List records** tool you just added.

> [!TIP]
> In case of issues, refresh the page.

5. **Rename** to `Get ServiceNow ticket details`

6. Change **description** to `Gets the details of an incident using its incident number. Use this tool when users ask about ServiceNow tickets, incident status, or IT support requests.`

> [!TIP]
> The description will help the AI know when to use that tool, so it's important to have clear instructions WHEN and WHEN NOT to use this tool. This is a key aspect of agent scoping - being specific about tool usage.

7. Under **Additional details**, change **Authentication** to **Agent author authentication**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In production scenarios, you may want to use the user context when making the connection to ServiceNow. Here, your context (as the author) is used by end-users of your agent when searching for incidents.

8. For **Record Type**, set a **Custom value** and choose `Incident`

9. Select **+ Add input** and choose **Query**

10. Select **Customize** and use this for **Description**:

    ```
    The output of this variable is the concatenation of numberCONTAINS and the incident number. E.g., 'numberCONTAINSINC0007001'. Only the incident number should be prompted and obtained from the user (e.g., INC0007001)
    ```

> [!TIP]
> Again, these instructions will be used by AI to understand how determine how to pass that information to the ServiceNow connector. In this case, how to use the very specific OData formatting of ServiceNow queries.

11. Select **+ Add input** and choose **Limit**

12. Select **Custom Value** and set **1**

13. Select **Save**

#### Test your IT Support Agent 

28. **Test** your agent:

    ```
    My USB port is no longer working on my PC... what can I do? While you're here, can you also share an update for case INC0000059? It's been quite a while since I've opened them... thanks!!
    ```

> [!TIP]
> Notice how the agent automatically:
> - Uses the appropriate ServiceNow tool based on the query type
> - Handles multiple tickets in a single request (e.g., if you ask for both cases INC0000059 and INC0000060)
> - Creates user-friendly responses with proper formatting
> - Combines ServiceNow data with other knowledge sources when needed

  ![alt text](images/multi-agent-servicenow.png)

29. **Observe** how your agent now demonstrates scoped capabilities:
    - **Tool Selection**: Automatically chooses the right ServiceNow tool based on user intent
    - **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation flow while using specialized tools
    - **Domain Expertise**: Provides IT-specific guidance and next steps
    - **Unified Experience**: Seamlessly integrates ServiceNow capabilities with other knowledge sources

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This integration showcases how agents can be scoped for specific domains while maintaining a unified user experience. The ServiceNow knowledge and tools are automatically triggered for IT-related queries, demonstrating intelligent capability routing within a single agent.

        "body": [
            {
                "type": "TextBlock",
                "text": "Please review and confirm the meeting minutes",
                "weight": "Bolder",
                "size": "Medium"
            },
            {

                "id": "attendees",
                "label": "Attendees",
                "value": "<Replace with MeetingAttendees>"
            },
            {
                "type": "Input.Text",
                "id": "date",
                "label": "Date and time",
                "value": "<Replace with MeetingDateTime>"
            },
            {
                "type": "Input.Text",
                "id": "summary",
                "label": "Meeting summary",
                "isMultiline": true,
                "value": "<Replace with MeetingSummary>"

                "title": "Confirm minutes"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

20. Select **Save** and **Close**.

> [!TIP]
> Notice how the Adaptive Card editor offers a visual editor to create your own Adaptive Card experience with a no-code/low-code editor.

21. We now need to make the card dynamic to reference the content that was returned from the prompt. Toggle from **JSON card** to **Formula card**.

22. **Expand** the formula for more screen real estate.

23. For each `"<Replace with ...>"`, **replace** with the matching `Topic.MeetingAINotes.structuredOutput.<property>` variable. 
  
    Don't forget to remove the double quotes.

24. **Save** your topic

25. Add a new **Message** node, and paste:

  ```
  Thank you! I've successfully logged your meeting notes in our systems.
  ```

26. **Test** your agent. Try to modify the content directly in the adaptive card before selecting **Confirm minutes**.

  ```
  Please help me with my meeting notes
  ```
