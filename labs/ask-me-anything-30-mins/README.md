## ü§î Why This Matters

**Makers and IT professionals** - Tired of employees constantly asking the same questions about policies, benefits, or system status? Frustrated by scattered knowledge across multiple systems?

Think of your organization's knowledge like a library:

- **Without an intelligent agent**: Employees waste hours searching through SharePoint folders, submitting IT tickets for simple questions, and interrupting colleagues for information that should be readily available
- **With an intelligent agent**: Employees get instant, accurate answers from a single conversational interface that automatically searches across all your knowledge sources with proper citations

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**

- "I can't find the leave policy for my country in our SharePoint site"
- "What's the status of my ServiceNow incident?"
- "I need information from multiple systems but don't know where to look"

**This 30-minute investment will save your organization countless hours and improve employee satisfaction by providing instant access to knowledge.**

---

## ü§î Why Start with ALM?

**New to Power Platform or Copilot Studio?** You might be eager to start building agents right away, but taking a few minutes to set up Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) first will save you hours of headaches later!

Think of ALM as preparing your kitchen before cooking a complex meal:

- **Without ALM**: Ingredients scattered across counters, no recipe plan, impromptu grocery trips mid-cooking
- **With ALM**: Ingredients organized, recipe prepared, everything measured and ready

**Common beginner challenges solved by ALM:**

- "I built something great in dev, but can't easily move it to production"
- "Someone changed my agent and now it's broken - who did it and how do I fix it?"
- "I need to update my agent but I'm afraid of breaking what works"
- "My team members keep overwriting each other's changes"

**The few minutes ALM setup in this lab prevents all these problems!**

---

## üåê ALM Introduction

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) ensures that your solutions evolve safely and efficiently as they move from development to production. This lab will walk you through the foundational best practices of ALM in Microsoft Copilot Studio‚Äîfrom structuring your solution to managing configurations and source control.

**Real-world example:** Imagine you've built a great customer service agent in your development environment. Without proper ALM:

1. Moving to production means manually recreating all your work
2. If something breaks, you can't easily roll back to a working version
3. When multiple team members make changes, work gets overwritten

With the ALM practices in this lab, you'll avoid these pitfalls and set yourself up for success!

## üéì Core ALM Concepts Overview

| Concept                  | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Solution**             | A standard way in Microsoft Power Platform to package and ship components‚Äîincluding Microsoft Copilot Studio agent components like topics, knowledge sources, and tools‚Äîacross environments alongside flows, prompts, environment variables, connection references, and any other solution-aware component types.                                                                                                      |
| **Publisher**            | A metadata element that identifies the creator of solution components. Using a custom publisher improves traceability and supports cleaner prefixes in naming conventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Environment**          | A workspace in Power Platform where no-code, low-code, or pro-code artifacts‚Äîsuch as agents, flows, and data‚Äîreside. ALM best practices typically involve multiple environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) to manage lifecycle stages. For admins, environments also provide governance controls to limit what makers can do, which connectors or knowledge sources can be used, and how assets are secured and deployed. |
| **Connection reference** | An abstraction that links connectors (e.g., SharePoint, Dataverse, ServiceNow, etc.) to credentials and environment-specific settings‚Äîallowing reuse and cleaner ALM processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## üåê Lab Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, employees need quick access to accurate information from multiple sources. Whether it's HR policies, IT incident status, or custom knowledge bases, information is often scattered across different systems, making it difficult for employees to find what they need efficiently.

**Real-world example:** Imagine Sarah, a new employee, needs to understand her health benefits. Currently, she might spend 30 minutes navigating through SharePoint folders, trying different search terms, or even asking HR colleagues. With an intelligent *Ask me anything* agent, Sarah simply types `What are the Northwind Health Plus Benefit plans?` and instantly receives the accurate policy document with proper citations, saving time and reducing frustration. She can also check on her ServiceNow incidents instantly using the same agent.  

This lab teaches you to build a comprehensive solution that transforms how employees interact with organizational knowledge, creating a single conversational interface that intelligently routes questions to the right knowledge sources and provides contextual, accurate responses.

---

## üéì Core Concepts Overview

| Concept | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Knowledge Source Integration** | Connects your agent to multiple data sources (SharePoint, ServiceNow, custom APIs) so employees get comprehensive answers from a single interface, eliminating the need to search multiple systems. |
| **Microsoft 365 Copilot Deployment** | Makes your agent available where employees already work, integrating seamlessly into their daily Microsoft 365 workflow for maximum adoption and convenience. |
| **Multi-agent orchestration** | Rather than relying on a single agent to do everything, build a multi-agent system where the main agent delegates tasks to a child agent. |

## üß± Use Case #1: Create a solution and custom publisher

Use a structured container to group all agents components for better lifecycle management.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Create a solution and custom publisher | Structure your success ‚Äì Group, manage, and deploy all your agent components with clarity and control. | 5 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll learn how to access the Solutions area of Copilot Studio, create a new solution, new publisher, and set the solution as default.

**Scenario:** Properly setup your development environment so that you can later easily package and deploy your agents to other environments.

### Objective

Set up your development environment by creating a solution and custom publisher in Microsoft Copilot Studio.

---

### Step by step instructions


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - You don't need to create a new solution if you already have one created in this environment. You can skip to the next use case if you already have one.

#### Open the Solutions area

1. Go to the [https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/).

2. Confirm you are in the correct environment (top-right corner).  In these labs, the environment name should start by **'DEV - \<your current User Name\>'**.

> [!TIP]
>
> - When you requested for a new user account using the **Training Assistant** agent, we auto provisioned a new Developer Environment with **'DEV - \<your current User Name\>'** as the name of the environment.

#### Create a solution

3. In the left navigation (under the `...` menu), select **Solutions**

    ![alt text](images/solutions.png)

4. Select **New solution**.

5. Enter **Training Workshop Agents** (or any other name you may choose) as the **Display name**. It will automatically add a **Name** for the solution (without the spaces).

> [!TIP]
>
> - Avoid names like `DEV`, `TEST`, `PROD`, `POC`, `MVP` or anything tied to a project lifecycle phase, as the same solution will move to different environments as part of the ALM process.
> - Use a descriptive, project-based name.
> - For example, if this is specific to this training and lab, use `Training Workshop Agents`

#### Create a publisher

6. If this is your first solution, click **+ New publisher** to create one. You can use **MCS Lab** as the Display Name, **MCSLab** as the Name, and **mcslab** as the Prefix and **Save**.

> [!TIP]
>
> - You may use your organization‚Äôs name.
> - While the **Display name** may contain spaces, the **Name** can't contain special characters and spaces.
> - Define a short prefix for use in technical names.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid using the default publisher or the default solution. Custom publishers ensure cleaner component names and better ALM hygiene.

#### Set and create

7. Check **Set as your preferred solution** (so any new component goes into it by default).
8. Click **Create**.

> [!TIP]
>
> - If you missed to set the solution as the preferred solution in the previous step, you can click **Back** to go to the Solutions page, select the new solution using the checkbox on the left, and use the **Set preferred solution** on the top nav.  

---

### üèÖ Congratulations! You've created your solution and completed Use Case #1

---

### Test your understanding

**Key takeaways:**

- **Solutions first** ‚Äì Solutions help manage your agent and related components across environments.
- **Lifecycle readiness** ‚Äì Structuring up front simplifies governance, updates, and deployment.
- **Naming matters** ‚Äì Use clean, environment-agnostic names.

**Lessons learned & troubleshooting tips:**

- Avoid names like `Dev` or `Test` in your solution name‚Äîthey‚Äôre misleading.
- If save fails, ensure publisher name is unique and valid.
- Keep solution names business-focused, not technical-phase focused.

**Challenge: Apply this to your own use case**

- What would you name your solution?
- How might you use solutions to organize future agent components?
- Try making another solution for a separate department or use case.

## üß© Use Case #2: Create connection references

Use connection abstractions for seamless multi-environment deployments.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Create  connection references | Adapt with flexibility ‚Äì manage credentials and services cleanly across dev, test, and prod. | 5 minutes |

### Summary of tasks

In this section, you'll learn how to create connection references in your solution.

**Scenario:** Configure your environment by anticipating future elements that will need to be updated as your solution moves from development to production.

### Step-by-step instructions

1. Open your solution.

2. Select **+ New**, then go to **More** and choose **Connection Reference**.

![alt text](images/environment-variable-connection-reference.png)

3. In the solution, select **New**, then go to **More** and choose **Connection reference**.

4. Use the connector name (e.g., `Service Now`) as the name. Optionally, prefix with your project name.

5. Select the connector (e.g., **ServiceNow**).

6. In the connection dropdown, choose **New connection** if none exists.

> [!TIP]
>
> - If the **Create** button is grayed out, it's just because you pasted the display name. Type an extra character in the display name field and remove it to be able to create.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - For **ServiceNow** configuration values, use the provided values in the <a href="https://aka.ms/MCSWorkshopLabAssets" target="_blank">**Lab Resources**</a> web page.
> - For **ServiceNow**'s `Instance` configuration, be sure to scroll down in the connection screen.

7. Log in through Power Apps in a new tab if needed, then close the tab to return to Copilot Studio.

8. Above the **Connection** dropdown, select **Refresh** and choose the newly created connection and click on **Create** to create the connection reference.

9. Repeat steps for the following connector:

    - `SharePoint` - *Use the Connect-directly (cloud-services) option and use the same user credentials that you got for this lab*

10. Validate that you see the two new connector references created in the project. Click on **<-- Back to solutions** in the left nav to return to the solutions page.

> [!TIP]
>
> - These connection references will be used later in the lab to connect to the two connection instances we created in the environment. When we export the solution and import in another environment, or use pipelines to deploy the solution, the same connection references can point to different connections configured for that environment (for e.g. Test, UAT or Prod environments).

- **Unified Experience**: Users get comprehensive support from a single agent interface

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Create a child agent

1. Go to your Ask Me Anything agent

2. Go to the **Agents** tab, and **+ Add an agent**

    ![alt text](images/add-agent.png)

3. Update
    - Its **Name** to: `IT Support Agent`
    - Its **Description** to:

      ```
      Use this agent for queries related to IT (e.g., knowledge base frequently asked questions, incident updates, etc.) 
      The agent can multiple multiple questions and queries at once.
      ```

    - Its **Instructions** to:

      ```
      Use knowledge for problem/how-to/questions.
      Use the Get ServiceNow ticket details tool to get the status of incidents.
      ```

#### Add knowledge to the child agent

4. Select **+ Add** in the **Knowledge** section of the child agent

5. Select **ServiceNow**

6. Choose the **ServiceNow** connection in **Created by my admin**

7. Select **Add**

#### Add ServiceNow ticket details as a Tool to the child agent

1. Still within the **IT Support Agent**

2. Scroll down to **Tools** and **+ Add a tool**

3. Search for  `ServiceNow List records`

4. Select **Add to Agent**, then **Save** your child agent, and scroll down to the **Tools** section and select the **List records** tool you just added.

> [!TIP]
> In case of issues, refresh the page with CTRL + F5.

5. Click on the Kebab menu (‚ãÆ) next to the `List Records` Tool, click **Edit**. Change the **Name** to `Get ServiceNow ticket details`

6. Change **Description** to:

    ```

> [!TIP]
> The description will help the AI know when to use that tool, so it's important to have clear instructions WHEN and WHEN NOT to use this tool. This is a key aspect of agent scoping - being specific about tool usage.

7. Expand **Additional details**, change **Credentials to use** to **Maker-provided credentials**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In production scenarios, you may want to use the user context when making the connection to ServiceNow. Here, your context (as the author) is used by end-users of your agent when searching for incidents.

8. For **Record Type**, set a **Custom value** and choose `Incident`

9. Select **+ Add input** and choose **Query**

10. Select **Customize** and change the Display name to **Incident Query** use this for **Description**:

    ```
    The output of this variable is the concatenation of numberCONTAINS and the incident number. E.g., 'numberCONTAINSINC0007001'. Only the incident number should be prompted and obtained from the user (e.g., INC0007001)
    ```

> [!TIP]
> - Again, these instructions will be used by AI to understand how determine how to pass that information to the ServiceNow connector. In this case, how to use the very specific OData formatting of ServiceNow queries.
> - If you get a "There is an error: 'DuplicateItem'" error, toggle to **Custom value**, then switch back to **Dynamically fill with AI** and set the customized **description** again.

11. Select **+ Add input** and choose **Limit**

12. Select **Custom Value** and set **1**

13. Select **Save**

#### Test your IT Support Agent

28. **Test** your agent:

    ```
    My USB port is no longer working on my PC... what can I do? While you're here, can you also share an update for case INC0000059? It's been quite a while since I've opened them... thanks!!
    ```

> [!TIP]
> Notice how the agent automatically:
>
> - Uses the appropriate ServiceNow tool based on the query type
> - Handles multiple tickets in a single request (e.g., if you ask for both cases INC0000059 and INC0000060)
> - Creates user-friendly responses with proper formatting
> - Combines ServiceNow data with other knowledge sources when needed

29. **Observe** how your agent now demonstrates scoped capabilities:
    - **Tool Selection**: Automatically chooses the right ServiceNow tool based on user intent
    - **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation flow while using specialized tools
    - **Domain Expertise**: Provides IT-specific guidance and next steps
    - **Unified Experience**: Seamlessly integrates ServiceNow capabilities with other knowledge sources

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This integration showcases how agents can be scoped for specific domains while maintaining a unified user experience. The ServiceNow knowledge and tools are automatically triggered for IT-related queries, demonstrating intelligent capability routing within a single agent.

30. **Publish** your agent and test the third Suggested prompt regarding ticket status in M365 Copilot (and Teams if needed). Note: you don't need to reload your agent or restart the conversation. Your Ask Me Anything agent is now capable to query Service Now and resolve support issues based on Service Now Knowledge bases as well as query Incident details for you.

## üèÜ Summary of learnings

True learning comes from doing, questioning, and reflecting‚Äîso let's put your skills to the test.

To maximize the impact of your "Ask me anything" agent:

- **Knowledge Integration** ‚Äì Connect multiple data sources to provide comprehensive answers from a single conversational interface, eliminating information silos
- **Seamless Deployment** ‚Äì Deploy to Microsoft 365 Copilot to meet employees where they already work, maximizing adoption and convenience
- **Multi-agent orchestration** - Rather than relying on a single agent to do everything, build a multi-agent system where the main agent delegates tasks to a child agent.

### Conclusions and recommendations

**Ask me anything agent golden rules:**

- Start with high-value, frequently asked questions to demonstrate immediate ROI
- Implement proper authentication and permissions to ensure knowledge security
- Use suggested prompts to guide users toward the agent's best capabilities
- Design context-aware experiences that reduce user input while increasing relevance
- Maintain human oversight for critical processes while automating routine tasks
- Monitor and analyze conversation patterns to identify knowledge gaps and improvement opportunities

By following these principles, you'll create an intelligent knowledge hub that transforms how employees access information, reduces support burden, and improves organizational efficiency through conversational AI.
