This lab demonstrates how Copilot Studio can move beyond simple chat-based interactions into **real-world automation and intelligence**.

By connecting to **Azure** services like **Blob Storage**, **AI Search**, and **Speech**, makers learn to:

- **Bridge data and conversation** ‚Äî allowing copilots to proactively respond to real business events such as new contracts or uploaded files.

- **Add enterprise-grade knowledge** ‚Äî enabling copilots to access and reason over indexed data sources securely.

- **Infuse AI capabilities** ‚Äî such as document understanding and transcription, without custom coding.

Together, these skills showcase how **Copilot Studio + Azure AI** can transform business workflows into intelligent, event-driven experiences that blend **automation, knowledge, and natural language**.

---

## üåê Introduction

As organizations adopt AI copilots across departments, the real value comes not from basic Q&A, but from connecting those copilots to **real business data and workflows**.

Modern enterprises generate information continuously‚Äîfrom uploaded contracts and customer calls to indexed knowledge in Azure. However, unless your copilot can access, interpret, and act on that data, its usefulness remains limited.

This lab focuses on closing that gap ‚Äî teaching you how to turn **Copilot Studio** into a truly **data-aware**, **event-driven assistant** powered by **Azure AI** and **Power Platform**.

This lab series (Lab 2) is designed to show how **Copilot Studio** can be extended through real-world **Azure AI** integrations. Each sub-lab builds on the previous one to help makers understand how to connect conversational agents to enterprise data, events, and intelligence.

The lab is divided into **three guided modules (2A, 2B, and 2C)** plus an **Azure setup reference** section:

- **Lab 2A ‚Äì Notify users when new contract documents are added to Azure Blob Storage**  
  Participants build an event-driven agent flow that monitors an Azure Blob container and proactively sends Teams notifications when new files are uploaded. This introduces the concept of *trigger-based automation* within Copilot Studio.

- **Lab 2B ‚Äì Configure Azure AI Search on Blob Storage**  
  Attendees connect Copilot Studio to a pre-created Azure AI Search index so their copilot can retrieve and summarize content from contract documents. This demonstrates *knowledge integration and semantic search* capabilities.

- **Lab 2C ‚Äì Speech-to-Text Integration with Copilot Studio**  
  Participants integrate Azure Speech Service with Copilot Studio to transcribe uploaded audio files and return the transcript through the agent. This module adds *AI-driven audio understanding* to the copilot's skillset.

- **Azure Setup (Reference)**  
  The appendix provides background on how the Azure resources (Blob Storage, AI Search, OpenAI embedding model, and Speech Service) were provisioned.
  For this workshop, all **Azure components are pre-created**, and attendees are supplied with the necessary endpoints and keys so they can focus entirely on building and testing within Copilot Studio.

Together, these modules illustrate how to evolve a Copilot from a simple chat interface into a connected, intelligent assistant that can see, search, and listen across enterprise data sources.

## üíº Real-world example

Imagine a **sales operations team** that handles dozens of new contracts and client calls every week.  

**Before:**  

- They manually check shared folders for new contracts
- Send an email or provide updates in Teams manually
- Listen to entire recordings just to confirm details

**After:** With the capabilities built in this lab, their Copilot automatically:

- Detects new contracts uploaded to **Azure Blob Storage**.
- Extracts key details like **contract number**, **vendor**, and **effective date** and posts a short update in **Teams**.
- Answers questions like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the renewal term for Contoso?‚Äù using **Azure AI Search**.
- Transcribes **customer meeting recordings** into text, allowing instant summaries or quick keyword searches.
