## 🤔 Why This Matters

**New to building intelligent agents?** You might think creating a sophisticated AI assistant requires complex coding or expensive tools, but Copilot Studio makes it accessible to anyone!

Think of building an agent like hiring a knowledgeable assistant:
- **Without an intelligent agent**: Users struggle with static FAQs, can't get contextual answers, and frequently contact support for information that should be self-service
- **With an intelligent agent**: Users get instant, accurate answers that combine your content with real-time data, reducing support tickets and improving satisfaction

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**
- "Our website visitors can't find the information they need quickly"
- "We get the same questions repeatedly that could be answered with existing content"
- "Our chatbot gives generic responses that don't reflect our brand or knowledge"
- "Users need answers that combine multiple sources of information"

**The 25 minutes you invest in this lab will transform how users interact with your content!**

---

## 🌐 Introduction

Modern users expect intelligent, contextual responses that go beyond simple keyword matching. This lab will guide you through creating Nova AI, an intelligent agent that can reason across multiple knowledge sources and perform real-time actions to deliver comprehensive, accurate answers.

**Real-world example:** Imagine a user asks: "Who founded your company, what's their background, and what's the weather like at their alma mater today?" A traditional chatbot would fail, but Nova AI can:
1. Search your knowledge sources for company history
2. Find biographical information about the founder
3. Look up their educational background
4. Check current weather at that location
5. Synthesize all this information into a coherent, helpful response

This level of intelligence transforms user experience from frustrating searches to delightful discoveries, while showcasing your organization's expertise and attention to detail.

## 🧱 Use Case #1: Create a new agent and add knowledge

Build Nova AI using the conversational creation experience and ground it with trusted knowledge sources.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Create a new agent and add knowledge | From idea to insight – Use the conversational experience to create an intelligent agent and enrich it with knowledge from websites like Wikipedia and your own files. | 8 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll use the conversational creation flow to define Nova AI, configure its tone and instructions, and connect it to websites and files to ground its answers in trusted data.

**Scenario:** Build the foundation of Nova AI, your intelligent agent designed to handle complex, contextual queries by drawing from reliable, grounded content.

### Objective

Create Nova AI with custom instructions and Wikipedia knowledge integration using Copilot Studio's conversational setup experience.

---

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Start the agent creation process

1. **Navigate** to [copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com).

2. Make sure you're in the correct environment by looking at the top right corner. In these labs, the environment name should start by **'DEV - '**.

2. Go to **Solutions** (under the `...` menu in the left-hand bar navigation). If you already have a solution, select it. If you don't have a solution, create a new one with a new publisher.

3. Once in your solution, select **+ New** and choose **Agent** > **Agent**.

#### Define your agent through conversation

> [!TIP]
> - You will be redirected to the conversational creation experience. It allows you to use natural language to help you configure your agent.
> - Note that this conversational experience only helps build and curate the agent title, description, instruction, and knowledge sources. 
> - The order or nature of questions may vary.

4. In the **Conversational creation experience** chat, paste the below answer to the initial question:

   ```
   An intelligent assistant that can answer multi-part questions by combining historical facts, biographical data, and real-time information like weather. Ideal for deep research, exploration, and knowledge synthesis.
   ```

5. When asked about a name for your agent, respond:

   ```
   Let's call it Nova AI
   ```

6. When asked about public website knowledge sources, set:

   ```
   Add https://en.wikipedia.org/ as a public data source for general knowledge and factual information.
   ```

5. When asked for more details, set:

   ```
   The assistant should answer complex questions using verified public information and real-time lookups like weather or conversions. It should give clear, concise answers and handle multiple questions one at a time.
   It must not speculate, share unverified or sensitive information, or compare products or companies.
   Nova AI should communicate clearly and professionally, using a friendly tone and light emojis 😊 when appropriate.
   ```

> [!TIP]
> - URLs can have up to two levels of depth (subpaths with forward slash /)
> - Copilot Studio doesn't do real-time web crawling. It actually uses the Bing index, so results depend on your website's Bing indexing quality and latest crawl date.
> - You can add up to four public website URLs for knowledge search at a time

#### Finalize creation

6. If you didn't start from your solution: Before creating the agent, select the **...** menu, go to **Update advanced Settings**, and choose the Solution you created.

7. Select **Create**.

## 🔄 Use Case #2: Disable general knowledge and add connectors

Ensure accuracy by grounding responses in your data while adding real-time capabilities.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Disable general knowledge and add connectors | Your agent isn't ChatGPT – Scope AI-generated answers on your data while adding real-time capabilities like weather lookup. | 7 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll disable general knowledge to reduce hallucinations, then add a weather connector to enable real-time data retrieval and test generative orchestration.

**Scenario:** Ensure Nova AI provides only fact-based, controlled responses while enabling it to perform real-time actions like weather lookups for comprehensive, multi-step answers.

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Test and disable general knowledge

1. **Navigate** to [copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and **open** the Nova AI agent.

2. **Test** your agent with this question to see general knowledge in action:

   ```
   Write a draft email to request refund from a toaster that is not working properly (bread keeps burning).
   ```

3. **Observe** how the assistant generates an answer from its general knowledge.

4. Go to **Settings** > **Generative AI**, and disable **Use general knowledge**, then **Save**.

5. **Close** settings, wait a minute, refresh the test pane, and test the same question again and see how the agent declines responding.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It may take a few minutes for the setting to be fully disabled. You may need to refresh and retry several times.

#### Add weather connector

6. Go to the **Tools** tab and choose **+ Add a tool**.

7. Search for `MSN Weather` and select **Get current weather** action.

8. Select **Add and configure**.

> [!TIP]
> - You may need to select the connection so that the buttons are not grayed out.

9. Under **Additional details**, set **Credentials to use** to **Maker-provided credentials**.

> [!CAUTION]
> - When using **Maker-provided credentials**, the end-user of the agent isn't prompted to use its own context and connection to connect to the service. Instead, it's using the context and connection of the person who has configured the agent.
> - Only use author authentication for actions that don't need user-specific data, as using the credentials from someone else can expose to data exfiltration risks.
> - Use user authentication for role-based access scenarios
> - Always review security implications of authentication choices

11. Under **Inputs**, for **Units**, for **Fill using**, select **Custom value**, and choose **Imperial** or **Metric**.

12. Under **Inputs**, for **Location**, leave **Fill using** to **Dynamically fill with AI**, but customize the value and set description:

    ```
    The location for the weather query. Valid inputs are City, State, Country. 
    Always include city and country, and state only for locations where appropriate (e.g., in the US)
    ```

> [!TIP]
> - The description of inputs is used by the AI to determine what value to set as it will try to automatically identify them from the context or more the queries the end-user has typed in.

13. **Save** the configuration.

#### Test generative orchestration

14. Test your enhanced agent with this complex question:

    ```
    Who is the current CEO of the company that owns GitHub? Where did they earn their MBA? What's the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment near that campus? What's the air quality index in that area today?
    ```

15. Notice how generative orchestration performs multiple searches and triggers the weather connector to provide a comprehensive answer.

## 💬 Use Case #3: Fine-tune your AI assistant for smoother conversations

Customize system topics to enhance interactions and deliver a smoother user experience.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Fine-tune your AI assistant for smoother conversations | Fine-tune for a flawless experience – Customize system topics to enhance interactions and deliver a smoother user experience. | 5 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll customize built-in system topics to improve user interactions and create a more seamless experience beyond just knowledge sources.

**Scenario:** Customize your assistant's welcome message to make it more engaging, add suggested start prompts to guide users effectively, and refine system topics like Escalate to ensure they align with your organization's needs.

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Customize the welcome message

1. **Navigate** to [copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and **open** the Nova AI agent.

2. Go to your agent's **Topics** tab 

> [!TIP]
> - Topics are **scripted conversational building blocks** of an agent. Topics can be used to design how a conversation dialog should play out in a deterministic manner (as opposed to letting the AI be in charge of the conversation and generating text). Topics can contain messages, questions, conditions, variables, etc. 
> - Copilot Studio agents come with pre-created custom and system topics. The default **custom topics** offer fundamental conversational abilities, such as Greetings, Goodbye, Thank you, and Start Over. **System topics** are also natively available and help manage specific conversation events.

3. Select the **System** tab, and choose the **Conversation start** topic.

4. Select the message and replace the text with a more personalized welcome message:

   ```
   👋 Hi there! I'm Nova AI, your intelligent assistant for deep research and discovery.

   I can break down complex questions and combine insights from historical facts, biographies, and real-time data like the weather ☁️🌦️.
   
   What are you curious about today?
   ```

> [!TIP]
> - Be clear and direct – Avoid jargon and long sentences
> - Encourage interaction – Provide a natural way for users to start asking questions
> - Set expectations – Briefly indicate what the assistant can and cannot do
> - Keep it concise – Too much information up front can be overwhelming
> - Use Markdown – Most clients support Markdown for advanced formatting options

#### Add quick reply conversation starters

5. While still on the welcome message, select **+ Add**, then choose **Quick reply**. These serve as suggested conversation starters for the end-user:

   - `What caused the fall of the Roman Empire?`
   - `Who is the current CEO of the company that owns GitHub? Where did they earn their MBA? What's the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment near that campus? What's the air quality index in that area today?`
   - `What's the temperature in the city that hosted the last Olympic Games?`

    ![alt text](images/conversation-start.png)

> [!TIP]
> - You can test your changes in a topic without needing to save. Just refresh the test pane to get the latest experience.
> - Quick replies display as **buttons** to the user, by default, when selected, the message is sent back to the agent as if the user had typed it.
> - Notice in the **Quick replies properties** how the type can be changed from *Send a message* (default) to *Open URL*, *Make a call*, or *Send a hidden message*, effectively helping create more advanced button experiences.

6. Notice the **Speech variation available** note. Toggle the experience from **Text** to **Speech**, and delete the "Thanks for calling, how can I help" variation (unless you use a voice channel for your agent).

> [!TIP]
> - The Speech variation can be useful if you add a voice or telephony channel for your agent. Voice experiences should traditionally be shorter, and you can use Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), an XML-based markup language, to customize text to speech outputs by adjusting pitch, adding pauses, improving pronunciation, changing speaking rate, etc.

7. **Save** your topic.

#### Customize the escalation experience

8. Go to your agent's **Topics** tab and select **System topics**.

9. Select the **Escalate** topic.

10. Update the text to options that will more meaningfully unblock the end user:

    ```
    I'm sorry, but I can't seem to be able to help you.

    I recommend reaching out to our [Microsoft Copilot Studio community](https://aka.ms/CopilotStudioCommunity) or submitting a [support request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/get-help-support).
    ```

> [!TIP]
> - **Escalation Triggers** – The Escalate topic activates when the end-user asks to speak with someone or when the Fallback topic fails to provide an answer three times in a row
> - **Insights from Escalations** – The Escalate topic helps track conversations that lead to escalation, highlighting gaps where users seek alternatives
> - **Disabling the Escalate Topic** – If you disable it, ensure the Fallback topic no longer redirects to it to avoid errors

11. **Save** your topic.
